We are now recruiting participants to be part of an online study to help us understand the use of a newly designed mobile app aimed at developing mental focus.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Are you above 21 of age?</li>
<li>Do you use a smart phone?</li>
</ul>
If you answered YES to these questions, you will be eligible to participate in our research study.
<br>
<br>
The purpose of this research study is to examine how habits of daily life mental focus are related to performance of a newly developed mobile phone-based random tapping task.

At the end of the 7-day period, you will be sent a link to answer a set of questionnaire items that should take about 5 minutes.
