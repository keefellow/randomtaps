IRB-2020-09-030

We are now recruiting participants to be part of an online study to help us understand the use of a newly designed mobile app aimed at developing mental focus.
•	Are you above 21 of age?
•	Do you use a smart phone?  
If you answered YES to these questions, you will be eligible to participate in our research study.

The purpose of this research study is to examine how habits of daily life mental focus are related to performance of a newly developed mobile phone-based random tapping task.

To take part in this study, you will be first be asked to provide informed consent on the next screen, followed by answering a set of questionnaire items that should take about 5 minutes. You will then be sent a URL link of a mobile web-application to use for the next 7 days at your own free time. You need not install any new app to take part in this study. At the end of the 7-day period, you will be sent a link to answer a set of questionnaire items that should take about 5 minutes.  

Your involvement in this study is voluntary. 

We will provide a $10 shopping voucher as a token of our appreciation, either as an online voucher or a physical voucher can be collected at NIE via appointment.
